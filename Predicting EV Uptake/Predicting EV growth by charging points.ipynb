    "Interesting that the City of London has so few compared to other regions. Perhaps this is due to it being a fairly non-residential area. As of 2021 there was a population of <9000 in a 2.91km squared area (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London)). Compare that to Barking and Dagenham, the area with the second least number of electric cars privately owned, which had a population of 218,000 in 2021 (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Barking_and_Dagenham))"
