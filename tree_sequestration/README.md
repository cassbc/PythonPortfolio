In this project I aim to create a function that will be able to calculate the CO2(kg) stored within a given tree.

### Current purpose
This function could later be hosted on a website where users can input some details about trees in their garden/area, and find out how much carbon they are helping to store.

#### Current variables
- tree circumference at 1.3m

#### Future (ideal) variables
- climate
- species
- age

Different species will store carbon at different rates, so adding species will be important. Similarly, trees growing in more tropical climates are found to store more 
than trees in arid climates, so this is an important calculating factor too. Both of these variables require data sourced from academia or government, I suspect.

Finally, a young tree just growing does not sequester the same amount of CO2 as a fully grown tree annually. It would be nice if I can differentiate between young trees/
saplings and fully grown trees. I'm not sure if this information is easily found.

### Future aims
It would be nice to be able to use the tool to make predictive estimates of future storage. E.g. I want to know how much CO2 I could save over 5 years
by planting 3 Eucalyptus saplings today.
