    "In this analysis we've aimed to find a viable category in which to build a free app that will see success in both the Apple Store and the Google Play Store. The aim being that after establishing an audience in the app, we can build in paid elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at both the Apple Store and Google Play Store data, it's clear that a shared popular category is Reference material. Music is also a well-downloaded app category, and one that in particular does not seem to already have a saturated base for apps that overlap with Reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's my recommendation that an app that meets these two categories - Music and Reference - may prove popular. An example may be an app that utises music preferences and players from more popular apps - Spotify, Amazon Prime, etc - and allows users to learn about the playing artist while listening to their music. Another option may be to have an app which gamifies finding similar artists - e.g. searching for your favourite, and then playing a game to explore similar artists and learn more about them as they play."
